# corona-tracker-project

The aim of this project is to bring together several courses-worth of learning and consolidate it on a single project.

The corona-tracker-project will work of the foundation of the coronavirus-tracker (a SpringBoot application that uses  Maven, Thymeleaf, Apache commons and Bootstrap), and attempt to employ the following features:

- Web programming with Python and JavaScript
- Building Modern Java Applications on AWS
- Advanced Software Construction in Java
- Using Python for Research

Along with these features, it will be developed using TDD, and thus will be documented with a fully-fledged testing framework.

As such, one of the first steps will be to write appropriate test cases for the already-present foundation of the project.
